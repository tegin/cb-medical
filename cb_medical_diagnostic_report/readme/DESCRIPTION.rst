This module expands the functionality of the medical_diagnostic_report. With this, an user has only access to the templates he has access to.
This model adds the concept of "Medical Department", "Medical Report Category" and allows to add the validation user's signature to the report.
In addition, it allows to add images to a report so they are placed in two columns at the report. Furthermore, images can be automatically imported from image studies.
