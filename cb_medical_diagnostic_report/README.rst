This module expands the functionality of the medical_diagnostic_report. With this, an user has only access to the templates he has access to.
This model adds the concept of "Medical Department", "Medical Report Category" and allows to add the validation user's signature to the report.
In addition, it allows to add images to a report so they are placed in two columns at the report. Furthermore, images can be automatically imported from image studies.

Medical Report Category

To create a new report category:

At the report you will find a page of images, where you can drop or add images and they will be automatically placed at the report in two columns. The images imported from the studies will also be added here.
